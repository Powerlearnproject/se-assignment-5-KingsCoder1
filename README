__QUESTION 7__

HOW TO CREATE, OPEN AND MANAGE FILES AND FOLDERS IN VSC:

In Visual Studio Code, you can create files and folders by right-clicking in the Explorer view and selecting "New File" or "New Folder," open files by double-clicking them in the Explorer or using Ctrl+O (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+O (macOS), and manage them by right-clicking to rename, move, delete, or open a context menu with additional options, all while leveraging keyboard shortcuts and the integrated file explorer for efficient organization and navigation.

HOW TO NAVIGATE BETWEEN FILES AND DIRECTORIES IN VSC:

Users can navigate between different files and directories efficiently in VS Code by utilizing the Explorer view for a visual file tree, using keyboard shortcuts like Ctrl+P (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+P (macOS) to quickly open files by name, and employing features like the "Go to File", "Go to Symbol", and "File Explorer" to quickly jump to specific locations or recent files.

__QUESTION 8__

Users can find and customize settings in VS Code by navigating to File > Preferences > Settings (or Code > Preferences > Settings on macOS) for a graphical settings editor or by editing the settings.json file directly. To change the theme, go to the Settings editor and search for "Color Theme" to select a new theme; to adjust the font size, search for "Font Size" and modify the value; and to customize keybindings, open File > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts and edit the keybinding rules directly.

__QUESTION 9__

STEPS TO TAKE FOR DEBUGGING 

1. Open your project
2. Install necessary extensions
3. Create a launch configuration
4. Set breakpoints
5. Start debugging
6. Inspect and control execution

KEY DEBUGGING FEATURES IN VSC

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) offers key debugging features such as breakpoints to pause execution and inspect code, and stepping controls (Step Over, Step Into, Step Out) to navigate through code execution line by line. It includes the ability to watch variables and view their values in real-time, along with a call stack to track function calls. The integrated Debug Console allows for interactive evaluation of expressions and commands, and exception breakpoints help catch and handle errors as they occur.

__QUESTION 10__

INTEGRATING GIT WITH VSC FOR VERSION CONTROL

Users can integrate Git with VS Code for version control by opening a Git-enabled repository in VS Code, which automatically enables the built-in source control features, allowing them to stage, commit, push, and pull changes using the Source Control view, while also supporting Git commands and configuration through the integrated terminal and graphical interfaces.

INITIALIZING REPOSITORY, MAKING COMMITS AND PUSHING CHANGES TO GITHUB

To initialize a repository in VS Code, open the integrated terminal and run git init in your project directory to create a new Git repository. Next, stage your changes by using git add . to include all modified files, or specify individual files if needed. Commit your changes with git commit -m "Your commit message" to save the changes to the local repository. Add a remote repository on GitHub by running git remote add origin <repository-URL>, replacing <repository-URL> with your GitHub repository's URL. Finally, push your commits to GitHub using git push -u origin main (or master if that’s the default branch), which uploads your local commits to the remote repository on GitHub.
